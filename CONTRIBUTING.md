# Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Please ensure your bug description is clear
and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

The absolute best way to report a bug is to submit a pull request including a
new failing test which describes the bug. When the bug is fixed, your pull
request can then be merged!

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
